  <h1>Wyth MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENT -- <br> Driver Member</h1>
  <h3>THIS CONTRACT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION (INCLUDING A CLASS ACTION WAIVER) WHICH MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE PARTIES.</h3>
  <p>General Description of Services. [Wyth] (“Wyth”) offers a carpool ride-matching platform geared toward providing a platform for college students who own vehicles and are looking to drive a carpool (each, a “Driver Member”) and college students who are looking for carpool rides (each, a “Rider Member”) to offer and search for carpool rides (the “Services”).</p>
  <p>General Purpose of Agreement. This Wyth Membership Agreement – Driver Member (the “Agreement”) governs the relationship between, and establishes the rights and responsibilities of, Wyth and you (“you” or “your”) as a Driver Member of the Services. In this Agreement, you and Wyth may be referred to together as the “Parties” and individually as a “Party” and Driver Members and Rider Members may be referred to together as “Users.” The terms of the following documents, all of which are available on the Wyth mobile application (the “App”) and Wyth website (available at www.Wyth.com) (the “Website,” and together with the App, the “Platform”), are incorporated into this Agreement by reference, as in effect from time to time: (a) Pricing Terms [Link] and (b) FAQs [Link] (collectively, the “Program Rules”).</p>
  <h3>Content Representations; Rider Member Eligibility</h3>

If, while you are a user of the Services, any Content which you Supply or have Supplied to Wyth or others in connection with the Services becomes inaccurate or incomplete at any time, you agree that you will promptly notify Wyth and any others with whom you have Supplied such Content. If you Supply any Content to Wyth or to others in connection with the Services that (as determined in Wyth’s sole discretion) is untrue, inaccurate, incomplete, fraudulent, or misleading, Wyth reserves the right to immediately terminate this Agreement and your access to the Services.</p>

      Offering a Carpool Trip.
  </p>
  <h3>Carpool Trip Definitions.</h3>
  <p>“<strong><i>Arrival Time</i></strong>” means the anticipated time that the Eligible Vehicle will arrive at a Destination Point for a Carpool Trip as indicated by the Platform;</p>
  <p>“<strong><i>Available Seat</i></strong>” means a passenger seat with a fully functioning seatbelt in an Eligible Vehicle which a Driver Member would like to make available for Rider Members to bid on with respect to a Carpool Trip;</p>
  <p>“<strong><i>Carpool Trip</i></strong>” means an upcoming trip a Driver Member plans to take using an Eligible Vehicle and that such Driver Member would like to make available for carpooling by allowing Rider Members to bid on at least one Available Seat;</p>
  <p>“<strong><i>Departure Time</i></strong>” means the time that a Carpool Trip will begin as indicated by the Platform;</p>
  <p>“<strong><i>Pick-up Point</i></strong>” means the starting location of a Carpool Trip as indicated by the Platform; and</p>

  <p><strong>Offering a Carpool Trip.</strong> If you are a Driver Member, you can use the Platform in order to offer Rider Members the opportunity to search for and bid on Available Seats for a Carpool Trip that you plan to take. In order to do so, you will use the Platform to Supply certain information about the type of Carpool Trip on which you are offering Available Seats for Rider Members to bid on including the Pick-up Point, Destination Point, number of Available Seats, Departure Time, and Arrival Time with respect to such Carpool Trip. After you Supply such information the Platform will take such information and “match” such Carpool Trip with Rider Members who may be interested in the opportunity to bid on an Available Seat for such Carpool Trip (each, a “<strong><i>Potential Rider</i></strong>,” and collectively, the “<strong><i>Potential Riders</i></strong>”). In order to Supply information about a Carpool Trip on the Platform, such Carpool Trip must have at least one Available Seat.</p>
  <h3>Matching Results</h3>
  <p><strong>Your Receipt of Content Supplied by Potential Riders.</strong> If Wyth identifies a Potential Rider for a Carpool Trip for which you have offered Available Seats, Wyth will provide you with certain Content Supplied by the Potential Rider. This Content will include the Potential Rider’s Profile.</p>
  <p><strong>Sharing of Content from Your Profile.</strong> You understand that not only will you potentially receive Content Supplied by Potential Riders (including their Profile Content), but that Content you Supply to Wyth (including the Content you Supply for your Profile) may also be made available to Rider Members looking for Available Seats on which they would like to bid. With respect to Content you Supply to Wyth, you grant Wyth, its affiliates, licensees, successors, and representatives an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, worldwide right and license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such Content and the irrevocable right to sublicense the Content with the sublicense having the right to transfer or sublicense the Content with the transfer or sublicense, respectively, having the right to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, publicly display, and prepare derivative works of, such Content (in whole or in part and including any such derivative works) and to incorporate such Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed. This Section [4.3(b)] will survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
  <p><strong>No Obligation or Guarantee Regarding Number of Potential Riders.</strong> While it is Wyth’s desire that you find Potential Riders to fill all the Available Seats on a Carpool Trip you are offering, Wyth does not guarantee that you will find any Potential Riders through your use of the Services, and Wyth does not guarantee that it will present you with any, or any specific number of, Potential Riders. Wyth also disclaims any obligation to continually or periodically update or rematch the Content you Supply in connection with searching for Potential Riders with any newly-available Potential Riders.</p>
