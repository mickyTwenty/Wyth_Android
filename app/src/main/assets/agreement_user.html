The Parties agree to attempt to resolve any Disputes by negotiation with the other Party (by phone, electronic correspondence, or written correspondence). If, after good faith discussions, a Dispute(s) cannot be resolved solely between the Parties, such Dispute(s) will be determined by arbitration in the [state][county] [of your primary residence at the time you last accessed the Services] before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong><i>AAA</i></strong>”) in accordance with AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This provision will not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

Except as may be required by law, neither Party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration under this Agreement without the prior written consent of both Parties.
